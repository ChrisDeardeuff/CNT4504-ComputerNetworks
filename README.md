# CNT4504-ComputerNetworks
The following files are from two programming assignments completed in CNT4504- Computer Networks


Assignment 1- Iterative Socket Server. 

The goal of this assignment was to implement an iterative (single-threaded) server for use in a client-server configuration to examine, analyze, and study the effects an iterative server has on the efficiency (average turn-around time) of processing client requests.


Assignment 2- Concurrent Socket Server.

The goal of this assignment was to take the iterative server, and turn it into a concurrent (multi-threaded) server for use in a client-server configuration to examine, analyze, and study the effects a concurrent server has on the efficiency (average turn-around time) of processing client requests.
